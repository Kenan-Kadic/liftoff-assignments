## Submission Instructions

### Overview

I want to create a User Login based website that allows people to compare flagship phone features/specifications, search for flagship phones by features, write reviews on phones, and examine purchase options.

•	Create Review Posts: Users will be able to create new review posts when logged in. New posts may appear in the user’s profile.
